PowerEnJoy - Software Engineering 2 project (@POLIMI)
=====================================================

As part of the 5 credit Software Engineering course we are asked to simulate the entire process of project development for a car-sharing company digital managment system. The aim is to learn how to provide all the necessary documentation before the actual coding phase begins, to guide the system devolopment through the selection of accurate goals and requirements, and to understand the interaction betweend us and possibile future stakeholders.

PowerEnJoy - Scope
-----

PowerEnJoy aim is to provide a car-sharing service for multiple cities with the peculiar characteristic of deploying exclusively electric cars. The scope of our project is to build a new digital management system to the company in order to support the service operations.

Contents
--------

Each repo subfolder contains the material used to redact the corresponding document.
The realease order of the documents is:

1. RASD (Requirements Analysis and Specification Document)
2. DD (Design Document)
3. ITPD (Integration Test Plan Document)
4. PP (Project Plan)

The last assignment is a code inspection review for and external project since in whole ours we don't actually get to write any line of code (except for some algorithms pseudocode).

All the documents final versions are produced under the Document Releases folder.

TODO
----

This section contains some possible improvements and corrections for each different document.

**GENRAL:**
* talk about localization apis (embedded for mobile, google api for web)
* adjust bookmarks with adobe acrobat 2015
* handle application development description

**RASD:**
* general typo correction

**DD:**
* general typo correction
* add discount alghorithm (battery related one)

**ITPD:**
* add subsystem test steps
* add more software integration examples (car subsystem, interfaces)
* add more on user interface applications (maybe move them to external commision)
* cover more inputs for the integration examples
* search for missing acronyms
* **Test descriptio tests**
* **Program stubs and test Data section**

**PP:**
